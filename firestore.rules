/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for EduGenius platform.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and schedules,
 * and a role-based access control model for classes, subjects, and courses.
 * Authorization Independence is achieved through path-based ownership for user-specific data (e.g., schedules)
 * and membership maps where collaborative access is required (e.g., classes with multiple teachers and students).
 * This avoids the need for get() calls in security rules, enabling atomic operations.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information; only the user can access their own profile.
 * - /classes/{classId}: Stores class information; access is controlled by a 'members' map within each document.
 * - /subjects/{subjectId}: Stores subject information; accessible by admins and teachers assigned to the subject.
 * - /courses/{courseId}: Stores course content; accessible to teachers assigned to the corresponding subject.
 * - /classStudents/{classStudentId}: Represents the many-to-many relationship between classes and students.
 * - /classTeachers/{classTeacherId}: Represents the one-to-many relationship between classes and teachers.
 * - /users/{userId}/schedules/{scheduleId}: Stores schedules for teachers; only the teacher can access their schedule.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile data.
 * - Classes have a 'members' map controlling access for teachers and students.
 * - Subjects are accessible by admins and assigned teachers.
 * - Courses are accessible by teachers assigned to the corresponding subject.
 * - User listing is disabled.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Class documents contain a 'members' map with user IDs and their roles (teacher, student).
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User profiles, classes, subjects, and courses are stored in distinct collections for homogeneous security postures.
